### Welcome to xScrape
xScrape is a work in progress PHP class for scraping web pages for data then diffing and storing results in to a database. It uses cURL and allows complicated targeting via a blend of xPath and regex.

### In development
xScrape is nothing yet, but will be something soon. I am currently completely rewriting it and only to core of the Class is available.
